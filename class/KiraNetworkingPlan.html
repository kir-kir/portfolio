                <p>	I think Twitter would be the best Networking site for me to use. I already have an account that I basically never use. I could turn this account into my business account and show off creations there. I can also add contact information in my about me section. There’s not many posts, so it would be easy to get started. It would be a remaster.</p>
                <br>
                <p>	I would like to possibly join the International Game Developers Association (IGDA). They have a page on Linkdin to follow. Their about page says they are a non-profit organization with the mission to advance careers and enhance lives of game developers. I would like to be a part of that. I can also use Linkdin to make professional contacts! There’s also my Discord account I could use to more easily talk with said contacts.</p>
                <br>
                <p>	I would like to attend Godot Con. Godot is a free and open-source game engine capable of amazing things. The 4.0 release that came out earlier this year added Vulkan support. This enhanced the 3D side of the engine and made it a viable option for 3D games. Every year they have an event where users of the engine can come together and talk about or share their projects. This year’s event has yet to occur, but I probably won’t be able to attend. I’m thinking I might be able to go after I graduate.</p>
                <br>
                <p>	There’s plenty of things I can do right now to start my network. To keep it on the simple side, I could refine my Twitter page and actually use it. I could also refine my Linkdin account and follow more game development organizations. Doing just those can help put my name out there. Another thing I can do is find a mentor in the community. These are just a few examples and there are plenty more things I can do.</p>
